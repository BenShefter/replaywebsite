                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>As a junior in high school and having played travel sports my whole life, I have a clear vision of what is needed to be equipped to play each sport at all levels. I understand the sacrifices families make to outfit their children to be safe playing the sport they love. I saw an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of many athletes. My goal was not just about scoring on the ice during my hockey games or helping get a win for my team, but it is about scoring in the hearts of those in need and making their athletic dreams a possibility, even if it is in one piece of equipment at a time. Many youth athletes are growing rapidly and they find theyâ€™re outgrowing their equipment once or even twice a season. Imagine having a seamless platform that connects these surplus, outgrown items with non-profit organizations across the East Coast. This not only ensures that the equipment finds a meaningful purpose and a new life, but it also contributes to the sustainability initiative by keeping these items out of landfills. By facilitating the donation and repurposing of equipment, my platform becomes a catalyst for positive change one donation at a time.</p>
